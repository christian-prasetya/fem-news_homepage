## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss/Sass
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- BEM CSS Method
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (for the responsive navbar)

### What I learned

What do I learn this time? A lot.

I am learning to create responsive mobile toggle navbar for the first time using vanilla SCSS and JavaScript, when using Bootstrap supposed to be easier choice.

I am learning more about grid layout, it's fun, but also little bit hard to do it right 100%.
